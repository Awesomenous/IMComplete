\title{Perform Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)}
\usage{
PerformUMAP(
  object,
  prefixes = NULL,
  markers = rownames(object),
  assay_name = "standardised",
  seed = 123,
  batch_corrected = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A `SpatialExperiment` object.}

\item{prefixes}{A character vector of prefixes used to subset the cells for
UMAP. Default is `NULL` (all cells are used).}

\item{markers}{A character vector of marker names to include in the UMAP.
Default is all markers (`rownames(object)`).}

\item{assay_name}{A character string specifying the assay to use for UMAP.
Default is `"standardised"`.}

\item{seed}{An integer seed for reproducibility. Default is 123.}

\item{batch_corrected}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, the `"batch_corrected"`
reduced dimension is used instead of the assay. Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to `scater::runUMAP`.}
}
\value{
The input object with UMAP results stored in reduced dimensions:
  - `"UMAP_full"`: UMAP on all cells.
  - `"UMAP_subset"`: UMAP on a subset of cells (if `prefixes` are provided).
}
\description{
This function performs UMAP dimensionality reduction on a
`SpatialExperiment` object. UMAP can be performed on all cells or a subset
defined by prefixes.
}
\examples{
# Perform UMAP on all cells
spe <- PerformUMAP(object = spe, markers = c("CD3", "CD4"))

# Perform UMAP on batch-corrected data for a subset of cells
spe <- PerformUMAP(object = spe, prefixes = c("B", "T"), batch_corrected = TRUE)
}
